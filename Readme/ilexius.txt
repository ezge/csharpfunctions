Task 1:
Write a function that return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
We will consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels. The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

Task 2:
Please create a function that when provided with a triplet (array/list of length 3), returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.
The input to the function will be an array of three distinct integers.
For example:
gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0
2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.
Another example (just to make sure it is clear):
gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1
10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is 1.

Task 3:
You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take an input array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:
likes([]) // must be "no one likes this"
likes(["Peter"]) // must be "Peter likes this"
likes(["Jacob", "Alex"]) // must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes(["Max", "John", "Mark"]) // must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes(["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]) // must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
For more than 4 names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.
